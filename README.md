# ADAM-Parser
This script is used to create a logged in adam session and fetch all your courses and course files for the current semester.

In order to use it, you must create a userdata.txt in the following style

userdata.txt
```
youremail@unibas.ch
adampassword
/path/to/course/directory
```

My userdata.txt would look like this:
```
julian.bopp@unibas.ch
notmyrealpasswordofcourse
/home/julian/UNIBAS/9 HS 2022/
```
